<p>A distributed trace is a set of events, triggered as a result of a single
logical operation, consolidated across various components of an application. A
distributed trace contains events that cross process, network and security
boundaries. A distributed trace may be initiated when someone presses a button
to start an action on a website - in this example, the trace will represent
calls made between the downstream services that handled the chain of requests
initiated by this button being pressed.</p>
<h3 id="trace" class="section-header"><a href="#trace">Trace</a></h3>
<p><strong>Traces</strong> in OpenTelemetry are defined implicitly by their <strong>Spans</strong>. In
particular, a <strong>Trace</strong> can be thought of as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
<strong>Spans</strong>, where the edges between <strong>Spans</strong> are defined as parent/child
relationship.</p>
<p>For example, the following is an example <strong>Trace</strong> made up of 6 <strong>Spans</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ascii">Causal relationships between Spans in a single Trace

        [Span A]  ←←←(the root span)
            |
     +------+------+
     |             |
 [Span B]      [Span C] ←←←(Span C is a `child` of Span A)
     |             |
 [Span D]      +---+-------+
               |           |
           [Span E]    [Span F]
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes it's easier to visualize <strong>Traces</strong> with a time axis as in the diagram
below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ascii">Temporal relationships between Spans in a single Trace

––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–&gt; time

   [Span B··············································]
      [Span D··········································]
    [Span C········································]
         [Span E·······]        [Span F··]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="span" class="section-header"><a href="#span">Span</a></h3>
<p>Each <strong>Span</strong> encapsulates the following state:</p>
<ul>
<li>An operation name</li>
<li>A start and finish timestamp</li>
<li>A set of zero or more key:value <strong>Attributes</strong>. The keys must be strings. The
values may be strings, bools, or numeric types.</li>
<li>A set of zero or more <strong>Events</strong>, each of which is itself a key:value map
paired with a timestamp. The keys must be strings, though the values may be of
the same types as Span <strong>Attributes</strong>.</li>
<li>Parent's <strong>Span</strong> identifier.</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong> to zero or more causally-related <strong>Spans</strong>
(via the <strong>SpanContext</strong> of those related <strong>Spans</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>SpanContext</strong> identification of a Span. See below.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spancontext" class="section-header"><a href="#spancontext">SpanContext</a></h3>
<p>Represents all the information that identifies <strong>Span</strong> in the <strong>Trace</strong> and
is propagated to child Spans and across process boundaries. A
<strong>SpanContext</strong> contains the tracing identifiers and the options that are
propagated from parent to child <strong>Spans</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TraceId</strong> is the identifier for a trace. It is worldwide unique with
practically sufficient probability by being made as 16 randomly generated
bytes. TraceId is used to group all spans for a specific trace together across
all processes.</li>
<li><strong>SpanId</strong> is the identifier for a span. It is globally unique with
practically sufficient probability by being made as 8 randomly generated
bytes. When passed to a child Span this identifier becomes the parent span id
for the child <strong>Span</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>TraceFlags</strong> represents the options for a trace. It is represented as 1
byte (bitmap).
<ul>
<li>Sampling bit -  Bit to represent whether trace is sampled or not (mask
<code>0x1</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tracestate</strong> carries tracing-system specific context in a list of key value
pairs. <strong>Tracestate</strong> allows different vendors propagate additional
information and inter-operate with their legacy Id formats. For more details
see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/#tracestate-field">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="links-between-spans" class="section-header"><a href="#links-between-spans">Links between spans</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>Span</strong> may be linked to zero or more other <strong>Spans</strong> (defined by
<strong>SpanContext</strong>) that are causally related. <strong>Links</strong> can point to
<strong>SpanContexts</strong> inside a single <strong>Trace</strong> or across different <strong>Traces</strong>.
<strong>Links</strong> can be used to represent batched operations where a <strong>Span</strong> was
initiated by multiple initiating <strong>Span</strong>s, each representing a single incoming
item being processed in the batch.</p>
<p>Another example of using a <strong>Link</strong> is to declare the relationship between
the originating and following trace. This can be used when a <strong>Trace</strong> enters trusted
boundaries of a service and service policy requires the generation of a new
Trace rather than trusting the incoming Trace context. The new linked Trace may
also represent a long running asynchronous data processing operation that was
initiated by one of many fast incoming requests.</p>
<p>When using the scatter/gather (also called fork/join) pattern, the root
operation starts multiple downstream processing operations and all of them are
aggregated back in a single <strong>Span</strong>. This last <strong>Span</strong> is linked to many
operations it aggregates. All of them are the <strong>Span</strong>s from the same Trace. And
similar to the Parent field of a <strong>Span</strong>. It is recommended, however, to not
set parent of the <strong>Span</strong> in this scenario as semantically the parent field
represents a single parent scenario, in many cases the parent <strong>Span</strong> fully
encloses the child <strong>Span</strong>. This is not the case in scatter/gather and batch
scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="metrics" class="section-header"><a href="#metrics">Metrics</a></h2>
<p>OpenTelemetry allows to record raw measurements or metrics with predefined
aggregation and set of labels.</p>
<p>Recording raw measurements using OpenTelemetry API allows to defer to end-user
the decision on what aggregation algorithm should be applied for this metric as
well as defining labels (dimensions). It will be used in client libraries like
gRPC to record raw measurements &quot;server_latency&quot; or &quot;received_bytes&quot;. So end
user will decide what type of aggregated values should be collected out of these
raw measurements. It may be simple average or elaborate histogram calculation.</p>
<p>Recording of metrics with the pre-defined aggregation using OpenTelemetry API is
not less important. It allows to collect values like cpu and memory usage, or
simple metrics like &quot;queue length&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="recording-raw-measurements" class="section-header"><a href="#recording-raw-measurements">Recording raw measurements</a></h3>
<p>The main types used to record raw measurements are <code>Measure</code> and
<code>Measurement</code>. List of <code>Measurement</code>s alongside the additional context can be
recorded using OpenTelemetry API. So user may define to aggregate those
<code>Measurement</code>s and use the context passed alongside to define additional
dimensions of the resulting metric.</p>
<h4 id="measure" class="section-header"><a href="#measure">Measure</a></h4>
<p><code>Measure</code> describes the type of the individual values recorded by a library. It
defines a contract between the library exposing the measurements and an
application that will aggregate those individual measurements into a <code>Metric</code>.
<code>Measure</code> is identified by name, description and a unit of values.</p>
<h4 id="measurement" class="section-header"><a href="#measurement">Measurement</a></h4>
<p><code>Measurement</code> describes a single value to be collected for a <code>Measure</code>.
<code>Measurement</code> is an empty interface in API surface. This interface is defined in
SDK.</p>
<h3 id="recording-metrics-with-predefined-aggregation" class="section-header"><a href="#recording-metrics-with-predefined-aggregation">Recording metrics with predefined aggregation</a></h3>
<p>The base trait for creating new metrics metrics is called <code>Meter</code>. It
defines basic methods like creating metrics with a name and labels. Structs
implementing the various metrics define their aggregation type as well as a structure of
individual measurements or Points. API defines the following types of
pre-aggregated metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter metric to report instantaneous measurement. Counter values can go
up or stay the same, but can never go down. Counter values cannot be
negative. There are two types of counter metric values - <code>i64</code> and <code>f64</code>.</li>
<li>Gauge metric to report instantaneous measurement of a numeric value. Gauges can
go both up and down. The gauges values can be negative. There are two types of
gauge metric values - <code>i64</code> and <code>f64</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Meter</code> API allows you to construct the metric of a chosen type. The SDK
defines the way to query the current value of a metric to be exported.</p>
<p>Every type of a metric has it's API to record values to be aggregated. API
supports both - push and pull model of setting the <code>Metric</code> value.</p>
<h3 id="metrics-data-model-and-sdk" class="section-header"><a href="#metrics-data-model-and-sdk">Metrics data model and SDK</a></h3>
<p>Metrics data model is defined in SDK and is based on
<a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/master/opentelemetry/proto/metrics/v1/metrics.proto">metrics.proto</a>.
This data model is used by all the OpenTelemetry exporters as an input.
Different exporters have different capabilities (e.g. which data types are
supported) and different constraints (e.g. which characters are allowed in label
keys). Metrics is intended to be a superset of what's possible, not a lowest
common denominator that's supported everywhere. All exporters consume data from
Metrics Data Model via a Metric Producer interface defined in OpenTelemetry SDK.</p>
<p>Because of this, Metrics puts minimal constraints on the data (e.g. which
characters are allowed in keys), and code dealing with Metrics should avoid
validation and sanitization of the Metrics data. Instead, pass the data to the
backend, rely on the backend to perform validation, and pass back any errors
from the backend.</p>
<p>OpenTelemetry defines the naming convention for metric names as well as a
well-known metric names in <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/README.md">Semantic Conventions</a> document.</p>
<h2 id="resources" class="section-header"><a href="#resources">Resources</a></h2>
<p>A <code>Resource</code> captures information about the entity for which telemetry is recorded. For
example, metrics exposed by a Kubernetes container can be linked to a resource that specifies
the cluster, namespace, pod, and container name.</p>
<p>A <code>Resource</code> may also capture an entire hierarchy of entity identification. It may describe the
host in the cloud and specific container or an application running in the process.</p>
<p>Note, that some of the process identification information can be associated with telemetry
automatically by the OpenTelemetry SDK or a specific exporter.</p>
<h2 id="propagators" class="section-header"><a href="#propagators">Propagators</a></h2>
<p>OpenTelemetry uses <code>Propagators</code> to serialize and deserialize <code>SpanContext</code> and
<code>DistributedContext</code> into a binary or text format. Currently there are two types of propagators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BinaryFormat</code> which is used to serialize and deserialize a value into a binary representation.</li>
<li><code>HTTPTextFormat</code> which is used to inject and extract a value as text into carriers that travel
in-band across process boundaries.</li>
</ul>
